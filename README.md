# Bank-Loan-Analytics-Project
End-to-end data analytics and business intelligence project analyzing bank loan data to identify risk patterns, predict approvals, and visualize key insights using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

Overview:
---------
The Bank Loan Project is a comprehensive end-to-end data analytics and business intelligence solution developed to analyze and optimize the loan approval process in the banking industry. It leverages modern data analytics tools and machine learning techniques to provide actionable insights into customer creditworthiness, loan performance, and portfolio risk.

Problem Statement:
------------------
Financial institutions face challenges in evaluating loan applications effectively and managing the risk of loan defaults.  
Traditional manual assessments are prone to inefficiencies, data silos, and inconsistent decision-making.  
The goal of this project is to:
- Build a unified data analytics pipeline to process and analyze banking and loan data.  
- Identify patterns and risk indicators that influence loan approval and default.  
- Develop predictive models to assist in data-driven loan decisions.  
- Create interactive dashboards for visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) to support business strategy and credit management.

Key Objectives:
---------------
1. Extract and load banking & loan-related data (loan applications, customer profiles, payments, defaults, etc).  
2. Cleanse and transform the data (handle missing values, categorical encoding, normalization, feature engineering).  
3. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand key patterns, relationships and risk drivers.  
4. Build predictive models (e.g., approval likelihood, default risk) using Python / machine learning.  
5. Deploy interactive dashboards (via Power BI / Tableau / Excel) for executives and data-driven stakeholders to monitor loan portfolio health, risk exposures and business performance.  
6. Provide business recommendations based on the analytics output (e.g., target customer segments, mitigation of high-risk loans, performance improvement).

Technology Stack:
-----------------
- SQL: Data extraction and transformation from relational databases.  
- Python: Data wrangling (pandas/numpy), modelling (scikit-learn) and automation.  
- Excel: Additional ad-hoc analysis, pivot tables, validation.  
- Power BI / Tableau: Visual dashboards for business users.  
- (Optional) Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab: For development, model training and experimentation.

Project Structure:
------------------
- `/data/` : Raw and cleaned datasets (loan_applications.csv, customer_profiles.csv, payments.csv, defaults.csv, etc)  
- `/sql/` : SQL scripts to extract, join and transform data from source tables into analytics tables  
- `/notebooks/` : Jupyter/Colab notebooks for EDA, feature engineering, model training and evaluation  
- `/models/` : Saved trained models (.pkl or .joblib) and associated metadata  
- `/dashboards/` : Power BI (.pbix) and/or Tableau workbook files for visualization  
- `/reports/` : Final project report, presentation slides and business-recommendation document  
- `README.txt` : This file – overview and instructions  
- `requirements.txt` : List of Python dependencies (e.g., pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib)  
- `config/` (optional) : Configuration files for database connections, paths, credentials (if any) – ensure no sensitive credentials are committed.

How to Run:
-----------
1. Ensure you have access to the source data (raw loan / customer files or database).  
2. Run the SQL scripts in `/sql/` to create the analytics tables/views.  
3. Install Python dependencies:  
   ```bash
